This repository hosts the files to our documentation website of a one week seminar to construct environmental sensorboxes at the University of Marburg. The seminar was closley linked to the reasearch project (Natur 4.0)[https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb19/natur40]. The development of the sensorbox is ongoing. We only documented the state of art during February/March 2019. If you are interested in the current designs be advised to check the official (documentation website)[https://nature40.github.io/Sensorboxes/] of the various sensor elements used in the Natur 4.0 project. Our website can be accessed via https://goergen95.github.io/sensorbox-docu/.
