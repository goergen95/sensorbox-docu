## Case Preperation

- 1x Case 
- 1x Hinge-set
- 2x Cable tie sockets
- 1x Raspberry Pie
- 1x Cooler set for Raspberry Pie
- 1x Board for jumper cables (only 1x (+)/(-) part)
- 1x Powerbank with USB power cable
- 1x Wireless charger
- 6x Rolls 
- 1x Raspberry Pie mounting plate (3D Part)
- 100 cm rope (2mm width)



- 4x M4x12 screws
- 4x C2,9x13 screws
- 6x M4x16 raised countersunk-head screws
- 6x M4 safty nut
- 6x M4 washers
- 1x jumpercable M-F red
- 1x jumpercable M-F black

### Drilling holes

First drill the holes for the hinges (with stencil from set, outter holes). Hint: first use 5mm drill (fit in stencil) and than use 6mm drill to expand the holes. Install hinges. Than drill the holes for the sensors on front of case with stencil """X""". Further drill the holes for the rolls on the sides with stencil """X""" (3,5 mm drill).

At least drill the holes for the suspension cable with stencil """X"""" (4mm drill). Insert the rope in both holes. Form a triangle with both parts 40cm long and fix the ropes with glue. Hint: make sure the holes are sealed completely.



### Attach Rolls

Use M4x16 raised countersunk-head screws with washer from inside to attach the roll and secure with a safty nut from outside but dont tighten it. Use instant glue under the washers and safty nuts than finally tighten the screws and nuts to assure waterresistenz.



### Install Raspy Pie and Power

Use M4x12 screws to attatch the Raspymount to the Case (the 4 sockets should be on the right side). Attach the coolers on the Raspy Pie. Put the raspy on the sockets (USB Ports to the right side) and fix it with C2,9x13 screws.

Paste the board on the bottom side of the Raspymount and connect it with the jumper-cables, red for + / black for -. Hint: leave 6 ports on the right out.

Paste duolock tape on the inner side of the cover (schablonna """X"2") and on the powerbank and  attatch the wirelesscharger on the powerbank. Connect the USB Powercable to the Raspy.

To start the Raspy Pie just connect the Powercable to the Powerbank. The Powerbank can be mounted in the correct position for wireless charging by the duolock.



## Sensor Preperation

### Lux-Microclimate-Sensor-Tower (LMST) (bis V1.1)

- 1x Temperature Sensor
- 1x Lux-Sensor
- 1x coverslip 25x25mm
- 1x MST Cover (3d Part)
- 4x MST Lamella (3d Part)
- 1x MST Bottom (3d Part)
- Xx jumper cables 

Braze = löten

lenghening = verlängern



insert the Lux-Sensor in the mount on the MST cover. Hint: the jumpercables should be connected an soldered before. Paste the coverslip on the mounted Lux-Sensor . Ensure that the glue (glue-gun) is sealing the space between the coverslip and the mount and . Hint: cut some grooves in the cooled off glue to secure that water can drain.

Connect all MST Lamellas to the MST cover and lead the jumper cables through the holes.

Paste the Temperature Sensor on the inner side of the mount plate in the MST bottom.



### CMPT Cheap-Microphone-(Tower) / EMPT Expansive-Mircophone-(Tower)

CMPT bis V1.1



Does not need any preparation.



EMPT bis V1.1

- 1x Microphone expansive
- 1x  Soundcard
- 1x Soundcable

Connect the soundcard to the Raspy Pie and attach the soundcabel.



### Camera-Mount (CAM) (bis V1.1)

- 1x Raspy Camera
- 1x 30cm Camera cable
- 1x Cameramount (3d Part)
- 1x coverslip 25x25mm

connect the cameracable to the Raspy Camera and put it into the cameramaount. Close the cap on the backside and paste the coverslip on the front. Ensure that the glue (glue-gun) is sealing the space between the coverslip and the cameramount. Hint: cut some grooves in the cooled off glue to secure that water can drain if the camera is adjusted flat.

### Realtime-Clock (RTC)

- 1x Realtime-Clock
- 4x jumper cables F-F (red, black, yellow, blue)
- 1x pin header with 4 Pins

Braze the Pin header to the realtime-Clock and connect the jumpercables.

### Hall-Sensors

- 2x Hall Sensor

- 4x jumper cable M-F (2xred, 2xblack)

- 2x jumper cable F-F (1x orange, 1x green)

Connect the jumpercables and adjust the sensitivity by turning the "pins". Hint: use a magnet to test if the sensor reacts.



## Sensor installation and sealing (till V 1.1)

- 1x Sensorphalanx (with duct depended on desired Microphone) (3d Part)
- 1x LMST (prebuild Sensor)
- 1x CMPT / EMPT (prebuild Sensor)
- 1x CAM (prebuild Sensor)
- 1x prepared Case



Insert the CMPT / EMPT trought the duct in the Sensorphalanx and fix it (with glue or some tape). Attach the CAM to the Sensorphalanx and insert the Camera-cable trought the opening and trought the cable canal. Insert all jumpercables from the LMST trought the opening in the Sensorphanalx and attach the LMST  Further fix it with glue.



Insert all cables from the Sensorphalanx trough the openings in the Case and paste the Sensorphalanx to the Case.



Seal all space betwenn the Sensorphalanx and the Case with silicon/glue. Further seal all openings from the inner side of the Case leading to the Sensors with silicon/glue.
