- 4x M4x12 screws
- 4x C2,9x13 screws
- 6x M4x16 raised countersunk-head screws
- 6x M4 safty nut
- 6x M4 washers
- 1x jumpercable M-F red

### 1.1 Drilling holes and attachments

First drill the holes for the hinges with the template from the hinge set at the backside of the containment box. Use a 5mm drill which fit in template and than use a 6mm drill to expand the holes. Install the hinges with the given screws included in the set. Then drill the holes for the sensors on the front of the containment box with template """X""". Further drill the holes with 3,5 mm drill for the rolls on the sides using template """X""" .

At least drill the holes for the suspension cable with 4mm drill and template """X"""" . Insert the rope in both holes and and fix the ropes with glue. The rope should be at least 80 cm long outside the containment box.  Make sure the glue seals off the drill holes completely. 

Paste the two cable tie sockets in the inner left side of the containment box and connect them with the 30 cm rope. Fix the rope with double knot. 

### 1.2 Attach Rolls

Use the six M4x16 raised countersunk-head screws with washers from inside the containment box to attach the six rolls and secure them with the six safety nuts from outside. Use instant glue under the washers and safty nuts and finally tighten the screws and nuts to ensure water-resistance.



### 1.3 Install Raspy Pi and Power

Use the four M4x12 screws to attach the Raspberry Pie mounting plate to the containment box. Then paste the heat sinks on the Raspberry Pie. Further put the Raspberry Pie on the sockets of the Raspberry Pie mounting plate with the USB-ports pointing to the right side and fix it with the four C2,9x13 screws.

Take one +/- part from the Breadboard and paste it on the bottom side of the Raspberry Pie mounting plate and connect it with the jumper-cables: red for (+) and black for (-).

Paste Duallock-tape on the inner side of the cover using template """X""""  and on the backside of  the Powerbank. Attach the wireless charger on the Powerbank and connect the USB-power-cable to the Raspberry Pie. Put the Powerbank on the inner side of the containment box cover.

## 2. Sensor Preparation

### 2.1 Lux-Microclimate-Sensor-Tower (LMST) (bis V1.1)

- 1x Temperature sensor
- 1x Lux-sensor
- 1x Cover-slip 25x25mm
- 1x MST-cover (3d Part)
- 4x MST-lamella (3d Part)
- 1x MST-bottom (3d Part)
- 3x Jumper-cables female/female in blue, yellow, violet 
- 3x Jumper-cables male/female in blue, yellow, violet 
- 8x Jumper-cables male/female in white, brown, black, red

  



First the jumper-cables need to be lengthen. Therefore connect the jumper-cables in each color with  female to male.

Alternatively the jumper-cables can be connected by soldering to improve durability. Here heat-shrink tubings are recommended to seal the cables form wetness. 

Connect the lengthened jumper-cables to the Lux- and Temperature-sensor.

Insert the Lux-Sensor in the mount on the MST-cover and paste the cover-slip on the mounted Lux-sensor . Ensure that the glue (glue-gun) is sealing the space between the cover-slip and the mount. Cut some grooves in the cooled off glue to ensure that water can drain.

Connect all MST-lamellas to the MST cover and lead the jumper cables through the holes.

Paste the Temperature-sensor on the inner side of the mount plate in the MST-bottom and connect it to the MST-lamellas while leading the cables trough the holes.



### 2.2 Cheap-microphone-tower (CMPT)

- 1x Mircophone cheap version

Does not need any preparation.

### 2.3 / Expensive-mircophone-tower (EMPT)

- 1x Microphone expensive version
- 1x  Soundcard
- 1x  Soundcable

Connect the soundcard and the soundcable to the expensive microphone version.



### 2.4 Camera (CAM)

- 1x Raspberry Pie camera module
- 1x 30cm camera-cable
- 1x Camera-mount (3d part)
- 1x Cover-slip 25x25mm

First connect the 30cm camera-cable to the Raspberry Pie camera module and put it into the Camera-mount. Then close the cap on the backside and paste the cover-slip on the front. Ensure that the glue (glue-gun) is sealing the space between the cover-slip and the Camera-mount. Finally cut some grooves in the cooled off glue to ensure that water can drain if the camera is adjusted horizontally.

### 2.5 Real-time-clock (RTC)

- 1x Real-time-clock
- 4x Jumper-cables female/female in red, black, yellow, blue
- 1x Pin-header with 4 pins

Braze the Pin-header to the Real-time-clock and connect the jumper-cables.

### 2.6 Hall-sensors

- 2x Hall-sensor

- 4x Jumper-cable male/female 2x red, 2x black

- 2x Jumper-cable female/female 1x orange, 1x green

Connect the Jumper-cables and adjust the sensitivity by turning the adjusting-screw on top of the sensors. Use a magnet to test the reaction: The Hall-sensors lamp should glow if it senses a magnetic field



## Sensor installation and sealing (till V 1.1)

- 1x Sensorphalanx (with duct depended on desired Microphone) (3d Part)
- 1x LMST (prebuild Sensor)
- 1x CMPT / EMPT (prebuild Sensor)
- 1x CAM (prebuild Sensor)
- 1x prepared containment box



Insert the CMPT / EMPT trought the duct in the Sensorphalanx and fix it (with glue or some tape). Attach the CAM to the Sensorphalanx and insert the Camera-cable trought the opening and trought the cable canal. Insert all jumpercables from the LMST trought the opening in the Sensorphanalx and attach the LMST. Further fix it with glue.



Insert all cables from the Sensorphalanx trough the openings in the containment box and paste the Sensorphalanx to the containment box. Close the bayonet lock for the LMST.



Seal all space betwenn the Sensorphalanx and the containment box with silicon/glue. Further seal all openings from the inner side of the containment box leading to the Sensors with silicon/glue.
