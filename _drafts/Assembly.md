# SensorBox Assembly

## Prepare Casing 

The casing of the SensorBox needs to be prepared to host the microcontroller as well as allowing the cables from the envrionmental sensors. We used the templates below to drill the 

- drill holes in Box (mit schablone) for cap, sensors and rolls
- attach cap
- attach rolls
- ((holder cord attachment))

## Insert Raspberry Pi

- insert RasPi holder (3d print)
- apply powerbank (in holder)
- glue board and connect power and ground from raspy to board
- install clock 

## Camera

- insert cam v2 in 3d print holder(Sensorphalanx) and attach cable, close cap

## Sensor Tower

- insert mirco in tower (sensorphalanx)
- for expensiv micro attach soundcard (calbe) to raspy)

## Lumen & Temperature Sensor

- connect all jumpercables to lus and temp sensor

- insert lux sensor to upper lamella (3d print)
- put temp sensor on lowest lamella
- combine all lamellas with metal spokes (metalspeichen)
- insert tower with reclosable repeatable seal

## Hall Sensors

- connect jumper calbes to sensores and raspy
- paste sensors 

## Connection to Microcontroller

- attach all cables to the raspy/clock 

- seal cable channels with silicon

- seal connections of phalanx to box with silikon

- if needed paste temp tower with gluegun to phalanx
