# SensorBox Assembly

## The Casing 

The casing of the SensorBox needs to be prepared to safely host the microcontroller and protect it from environmental influences such as rain and UV-radiation. Also, the cables transmitting the signals from the environmental sensors need to reach the microcontroller without moisture entering the inside of the casing. Thirdly, the box needs wheels attached to it to ensure it can be used as a cable car between two ropes stretched along a tree.

We created some [templates](assets/templates.pdf) which can be used to find the correct positions to drill the holes. Make sure you use the short sides of the boxes to attach the wheels, while the upper long side of the box will be used to attach the sensor tower later. The attached wheels should look like this:

The holes for entering the sensor cables into the casing should look like this:

## Insert Raspberry Pi

- insert RasPi holder (3d print)
- apply powerbank (in holder)
- glue board and connect power and ground from raspy to board
- install clock 

## Camera

- insert cam v2 in 3d print holder(Sensorphalanx) and attach cable, close cap

## Sensor Tower

- insert mirco in tower (sensorphalanx)
- for expensiv micro attach soundcard (calbe) to raspy)

## Lumen & Temperature Sensor

- connect all jumpercables to lus and temp sensor

- insert lux sensor to upper lamella (3d print)
- put temp sensor on lowest lamella
- combine all lamellas with metal spokes (metalspeichen)
- insert tower with reclosable repeatable seal

## Hall Sensors

- connect jumper calbes to sensores and raspy
- paste sensors 

## Connection to Microcontroller

- attach all cables to the raspy/clock 

- seal cable channels with silicon

- seal connections of phalanx to box with silikon

- if needed paste temp tower with gluegun to phalanx
