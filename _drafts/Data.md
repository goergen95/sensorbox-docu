# Data

In a simple test run of our sensorboxes we placed all of them next to each other overnight. In total, we placed six boxes. One box showed issues in saving the data to disk, so we could not include it's results in the analysis. Another box did not collect temperature and humidity data, so we only have 4 boxes to compare the measurements for these two variables.  The illuminance sensor worked for all boxes, but since we made our test run overnight, there are not as many observations to compare.
