      <p>On this site, you will find information for the assembly and usage of the Sensorboxes. They were build in the course of a one-week master's seminar at the University of Marburg. The aim of this seminar was to build up a fully deployable box equipped with various sensor to monitor some basic envrionmental variables. The seminar is closely linked to the LOEWE research project Nature 4.0.</p>
